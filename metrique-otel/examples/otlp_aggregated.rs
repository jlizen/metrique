//! Recommended high-throughput topology: `KeyedAggregator -> WorkerSink ->
//! OtelSink`. Many source entries roll up into a single OTLP export per
//! (key) tuple.
//!
//! Compared to the raw `otlp_grpc.rs` example, this path:
//! - groups requests by `Operation` (the `#[aggregate(key)]` field) so each
//!   distinct operation gets its own attribute set on the OTLP wire
//! - sums request counts inside the aggregator before recording on the OTel
//!   counter, so high-volume callers don't pay one OTEL `add()` per request
//! - collects per-request latencies into a `Histogram` distribution that is
//!   merged into one OTLP histogram export per flush.
//!
//! Run with the same environment variables as `otlp_grpc.rs`:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317 \
//! OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=metrique-otel-example \
//!     cargo run -p metrique-otel --example otlp_aggregated
//! ```
