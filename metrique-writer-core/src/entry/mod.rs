/// The core trait to be implemented by application data structures holding metric values.
///
/// Implementations of [`Entry`] should generally be pure functions, emitting the same metric values
/// independent of the environment. External dependencies, such as metrics that are relative to
/// the current time, or metrics that refer to the value behind a mutex or atomic, should be resolved
/// before creating an [`Entry`].
///
/// It's analogous to the [`std::fmt::Display`] trait that works with a [`std::fmt::Formatter`] to display a value as a
/// string. In this case, the implementer of `Entry` contains the metric data and works with an [`EntryWriter`] to write
/// the data as a metric entry in some format. The `EntryWriter` trait abstracts away the different formatting logic
/// from the `Entry` implementer, just like `Formatter` does for `Display` implementers.
///
/// ## Creating Entries
///
/// The `metrique` crate provides abstractions for easily creating an [`Entry`] while having a step
/// where dependencies of the metric on external value can be resolved.
///
/// If your [`Entry`] does not need to contain external dependencies and you are not using `metrique`,
/// the easiest way of creating an [`Entry`] is by using `derive(Entry)`, for example:
///
/// ```
/// # use std::time::{Duration, SystemTime};
/// # use metrique_writer::Entry;
/// # use metrique_writer::unit::{AsBytes, AsMicroseconds};
///
/// #[derive(Entry, Debug)]
/// #[entry(rename_all = "PascalCase")]
/// struct RequestMetrics {
///     #[entry(timestamp)]
///     request_start: SystemTime,
///     // emitted as `0` or `1`
///     success: bool,
///     // will be skipped if `None`
///     optional_value: Option<u32>,
///     byte_size: AsBytes<u64>,
///     // An `Entry` can nest inner `Entry` structs
///     #[entry(flatten)]
///     subprocess: SubprocessMetrics,
/// }
///
/// #[derive(Entry, Default, Debug)]
/// #[entry(rename_all = "PascalCase")]
/// struct SubprocessMetrics {
///     counter: u32,
///     // this Duration will be emitted as milliseconds (the default)
///     duration: Duration,
///     // this Duration will be emitted as microseconds
///     duration_microseconds: AsMicroseconds<Duration>,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// You can also implement the [`Entry`] trait manually (this does the same as the
/// macro-using code above):
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use metrique_writer_core::{Entry, EntryWriter};
/// # use std::time::{Duration, SystemTime};
/// # use metrique_writer::unit::{AsBytes, AsMicroseconds};
///
/// struct RequestMetrics {
///     request_start: SystemTime,
///     // emitted as `0` or `1`
///     success: bool,
///     // will be skipped if `None`
///     optional_value: Option<u32>,
///     byte_size: AsBytes<u64>,
///     // Multiple entries can be merged or flattened into a single written entry by
///     // invoking [`Entry::write()`] multiple times with the same `EntryWriter`.
///     // This makes nesting separate structs easy.
///     subprocess: SubprocessMetrics,
/// }
///
/// struct SubprocessMetrics {
///     counter: u32,
///     // this Duration will be emitted as milliseconds (the default
///     // of `impl Value for Duration` and `impl MetricValue for Duration`).
///     duration: Duration,
///     // this Duration will be emitted as microseconds
///     duration_microseconds: AsMicroseconds<Duration>,
/// }
///

///         writer.timestamp(self.request_start);
///         writer.value("Success", &self.success);
